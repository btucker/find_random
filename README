Find Random
==========

The plugin provides a (somewhat) scalable way to select random rows from a table.  It runs
significantly faster than asking most databases to "ORDER BY RAND()".  Behind the scenes it
grabs all ids that match the query conditions, then selects a random subset of these for which 
it then asks the database for the full records. The initial query is done outside of ActiveRecord
to avoid needless object instantiation.

Usage
----

To use:

  # select 5 random itemss that match the :conditions
  @items = Item.random(5, :conditions => ["col1 = ? or col2 = ?", val1, val2])

  # select any 5 random items
  @items = Item.random(5)


Limitations
-----------

Currently this plugin does not support joins.  Additionally the current implementation is considerably
memory inefficient and probably won't perform well on tables with greater than 100,000 rows.  YMMV.


Benchmark
---------

Comparing this method against ORDER BY RAND() in MySQL on a table with 30,000 rows:

  $ ./script/performance/benchmarker 1 'Person.random(8)' 'Person.find(:all, :order => "RAND()", :limit => 8)'
            user     system      total        real
            #1      0.030000   0.000000   0.030000 (  0.149027)
            #2      0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  5.516728)
