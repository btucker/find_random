Find Random
==========

The plugin provides a (somewhat) scalable way to select random rows from a table.  It runs
significantly faster than asking most databases to "ORDER BY RAND()".  Behind the scenes it
grabs all ids that match the query conditions, then selects a random subset of these for which 
it then asks the database for the full records. The initial query is done outside of ActiveRecord
to avoid needless object instantiation.

Usage
----

To use:

  # select 5 random results that match the :condition
  @items = Item.random(5, :conditions => ["col1 = ? or col2 = ?", val1, val2])

The :conditions argument is optional.

Limitations
-----------

Currently this plugin does not support joins.  Additionally the current implementation is considerably
memory inefficient and probably won't perform well on tables with greater than 50,000 rows.  YMMV.

Benchmark
---------

Comparing this method against ORDER BY RAND() in MySQL on a table with 30,000 rows:

$ ./script/performance/benchmarker 1 'Person.random(8)' 'Person.find(:all, :order => "RAND()", :limit => 8)'
            user     system      total        real
            #1      0.110000   0.000000   0.110000 (  0.203106)
            #2      0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  4.760947)
